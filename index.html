      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div class="paragraph1">
        <p>
          I'd say that I'm pretty open-minded, extroverted to an extent and am
          willing to learn and experience new things, and if I don't like
          something I'll try to express it ASAP to not waste time. I guess you
          could call me productive & disciplined, but that's only if I enjoy
          what I'm doing ofcourse. &#160; :)

      <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
      <div class="paragraph2">
        <p>
          First off I'll have to say that I've been an active person for as long
          as I can remember. What striked me the most was the gym and
          weightlifting, which I've been training for almost two and a half
          years now. Before I had my knee accident I was also into
          mountainbiking, and yes because of the accident it limited my physical
          freedom. That's why I since then got deeper into philosyphy &
          psychology because I couldn't do the things I usually could do, I
          basically went from thinking about doing things to thinking more about
          people and theories.

      <h2>FAMILY & FRIENDS</h2>
      <div class="paragraph3">
        <p>
          My family consists of my dad, my mum, my three brothers and I. I'm the
          middle child out of the fully blood related kids, but my oldest
          brother is technically a half brother from my dad's side of the
          family. I have several friends that I cherish to the fullest. They're
          there for me when I need it, emotionally & acedemically. Strong bonds
          with friends make your life so much easier, if they need anything,
          I'll try to provide and vice versa.
